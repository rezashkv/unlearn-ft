### Updated code ðŸš€ - Now support diffusers!! (Faster and cleaner)

## Code Update ðŸš€
We are releasing a cleaner code for ESD with diffusers support. Compared to our old-code this version uses almost half the GPU memory and is 5-8 times faster. Because of this diffusers support - we believe it allows to generalise to latest models (FLUX ESD coming soon ... ) <br>

To use the older version please go to `oldcode_erasing_compvis/` folder in this repository [here](https://github.com/rohitgandikota/erasing/tree/main/oldcode_erasing_compvis)

## Installation Guide
We recently updated our codebase to be much more cleaner and faster. The setup is also simple
```
git clone https://github.com/rohitgandikota/erasing.git
cd erasing
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training Guide

After installation, follow these instructions to train a custom ESD model. Pick from following `'xattn'`,`'noxattn'`, `'selfattn'`, `'full'`:
```
python esd_diffusers.py --erase_concept 'Van Gogh' --train_method 'xattn'
```

ðŸ’¡ New application: You can now erase an attribute from a concept!! Instead of erasing a whole concept you can just precisely remove some of its attributes. For example, you can erase hats from cowboys but keep the rest intact!
```
python esd_diffusers.py --erase_concept 'cowboy hat' --erase_from 'cowboy' --train_method 'xattn'
```

The optimization process for erasing undesired visual concepts from pre-trained diffusion model weights involves using a short text description of the concept as guidance. The ESD model is fine-tuned with the conditioned and unconditioned scores obtained from frozen SD model to guide the output away from the concept being erased. The model learns from it's own knowledge to steer the diffusion process away from the undesired concept.

## Generating Images

Generating images from custom ESD model is super easy. Please follow `inference.ipynb` notebook

### UPDATE (NudeNet)
If you want to recreate the results from our paper on NSFW task - please use this https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J_O-yZMabmS9gBA2qsFSrmFoCl7tbFgK/view?usp=sharing

* Untar this file and save it in the homedirectory '~/.NudeNet'
* This should enable the right results as we use this checkpoint for our analysis.

## Running Gradio Demo Locally

To run the gradio interactive demo locally, clone the files from [demo repository](https://huggingface.co/spaces/baulab/Erasing-Concepts-In-Diffusion/tree/main) <br>

* Create an environment using the packages included in the requirements.txt file
* Run `python app.py`
* Open the application in browser at `http://127.0.0.1:7860/`
* Train, evaluate, and save models using our method
